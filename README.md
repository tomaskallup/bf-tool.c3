# BF Tool
A Brainf**k tool written in C3.

## Planned Features
 - [ ] Evaluate a Brainf**k file (somewhat working)
 - [ ] Brainf**k REPL
 - [ ] Brainf**k -> C compiler

## Usage
Currently it can only read, parse & evaluate a Brainf**k file.
```
$ c3c run -- <FILE>
```
Or build and execute binary yourself.
```
$ c3c build
$ ./build/c3_bftool <FILE>
```
